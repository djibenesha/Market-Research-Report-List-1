<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Brake Booster Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Disc Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydraulic brake booster market encompasses two primary types: drum brakes and disc brakes. Drum brakes utilize a cylindrical design where brake shoes press against the inner surface of a drum to create friction, commonly found in older vehicles and some light-duty applications. Conversely, disc brakes feature a flat rotor disc where brake pads clamp down, offering superior stopping power and heat dissipation, making them prevalent in modern vehicles. Both types enhance braking efficiency but cater to different automotive needs and preferences.</p></p>
