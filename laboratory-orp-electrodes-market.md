<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory ORP Electrodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Junction</li><li>Double Junction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory ORP (Oxidation-Reduction Potential) electrodes come primarily in two types: single junction and double junction. Single junction electrodes consist of one electrolyte reference chamber, simpler and more cost-effective, but may be prone to contamination. In contrast, double junction electrodes feature two separate reference chambers, providing enhanced protection against contamination and longer lifespan. These distinctions lead to varied applications; single junctions are often used in less demanding environments, while double junctions are preferred for more sensitive and accurate measurements in challenging conditions.</p></p>
